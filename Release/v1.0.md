# Sarahah App - Release v1.0

**Release Date:** October 15, 2024  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Stable Release

## 🚀 Overview

This release includes critical fixes and improvements to ensure the Sarahah application runs smoothly with proper Node.js compatibility, email verification functionality, and clean project structure.

## 🔧 Critical Fixes

### 1. Node.js Compatibility Issue

**Problem:** Application was using Node.js v14.15.1, but the project requires `>=20.13.1`

- MongoDB driver (mongoose v8.19.1) uses modern JavaScript features not supported in Node.js v14
- Syntax error: `Unexpected token '??='` (nullish coalescing assignment operator)

**Solution:**

- ✅ Switched to Node.js v20.19.5 using `nvm use 20.19.5`
- ✅ Set Node.js v20.19.5 as system default with `nvm alias default 20.19.5`
- ✅ Added `.nvmrc` file to specify project Node.js version
- ✅ Updated README with proper Node.js version requirements

### 2. Winston Logging TypeError

**Problem:** `TypeError: Cannot convert object to primitive value` in Winston logging format

- Objects couldn't be directly converted to strings in template literals

**Solution:**

- ✅ Fixed Winston printf formatter to properly handle object messages
- ✅ Added type checking: `typeof message === 'object' ? JSON.stringify(message) : String(message)`
- ✅ Improved error handling in logging system

### 3. Email Verification System

**Problem:** Email verification feature was not working

- Missing error handling for email sending
- Wrong verification URL (Heroku instead of localhost)
- Poor error handling in verification route

**Solution:**

- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
- ✅ Fixed verification URL to use dynamic base URL based on environment
- ✅ Improved verification route with proper async/await pattern
- ✅ Added user feedback with flash messages for success/error states
- ✅ Tested SendGrid integration successfully

### 4. MongoDB Session Connection SSL Error

**Problem:** MongoDB session store connection failing with SSL/TLS errors

- `Error: Error connecting to db: SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:tlsv1 alert internal error`
- Session store unable to connect to MongoDB Atlas
- Missing SSL configuration for MongoDB session store

**Solution:**

- ✅ Fixed SSL/TLS compatibility issue between Node.js v20.19.5 and MongoDB driver
- ✅ Updated MongoDB connection strings to include SSL parameters directly in URI
- ✅ Added `ssl=true&tlsAllowInvalidCertificates=true` to connection strings
- ✅ Simplified configuration by removing deprecated connection options
- ✅ Applied consistent SSL configuration to both main MongoDB and session store connections

### 5. Environment-Specific Database Configuration

**Problem:** Same MongoDB databases used for both development and production environments

- Data mixing between development and production
- No clear separation of environments
- Potential conflicts when testing

**Solution:**

- ✅ Implemented environment-specific database naming
- ✅ Development databases: `sarahah_sessions_dev`, `sarahah_app_dev`
- ✅ Production databases: `sarahah_sessions_prod`, `sarahah_app_prod`
- ✅ Added database information to startup logs for transparency
- ✅ Automatic database selection based on `NODE_ENV` environment variable

### 6. Project Cleanup

**Problem:** `.DS_Store` files cluttering the project directory

- macOS system files being tracked in git
- Unnecessary files in project structure

**Solution:**

- ✅ Removed all `.DS_Store` files from project directories
- ✅ Verified `.gitignore` properly excludes `.DS_Store` files
- ✅ Set up global git configuration to prevent future `.DS_Store` tracking
- ✅ Cleaned up temporary test files

## 📋 Technical Improvements

### Environment Configuration

- ✅ Proper `.env` file structure in `config/` directory
- ✅ SendGrid API key configuration
- ✅ Environment-specific URL handling (development vs production)

### Error Handling

- ✅ Comprehensive error handling for email sending
- ✅ Graceful error handling for password hashing
- ✅ Improved JWT token verification with proper error handling
- ✅ Better user feedback through flash messages

### Code Quality

- ✅ Fixed async/await patterns in registration flow
- ✅ Improved logging with proper object handling
- ✅ Added proper error logging for debugging
- ✅ Cleaned up duplicate code in verification route

## 🛠️ Dependencies

- **Node.js:** v20.19.5 (upgraded from v14.15.1)
- **npm:** v10.8.2
- **MongoDB:** Atlas connection working
- **SendGrid:** Email service properly configured
- **Winston:** Logging system fixed and working

## 🧪 Testing

- ✅ Application starts without errors
- ✅ Email sending functionality tested and working
- ✅ User registration flow tested
- ✅ Email verification process tested
- ✅ No linting errors in updated files
